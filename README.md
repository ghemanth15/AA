MyDocs contains the files related to taskbots executions and MyTasks contain the code for performing the operation.
Most of the usecases deal with extraction of data from excel and website, Object cloning, keystrokes, image recognition etc.

For executing these taskbots initially download Automation Anywhere Community edition from https://www.automationanywhere.com/in/lp/free-trial and then execute the taskbots. All the usecases are dealt with execution of the taskbots.
